# Integrated Motion Analysis

Welcome to the **Integrated Motion Analysis** project! This application uses a deep learning model to predict the type of physical activity being performed in a video. The project is built with a Flask backend that handles video processing and model prediction, and a React frontend that allows users to upload videos and view prediction results.

## Features

- **Video Upload**: Users can upload a video file in formats like `.mp4`, `.avi`, or `.mov`.
- **Activity Prediction**: The backend processes the video and predicts the activity being performed using a trained deep learning model.
- **Confidence Score**: The prediction is accompanied by a confidence score, indicating the model's certainty.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is designed to be responsive and visually appealing.

Backend (Flask)
Python: Handles video processing and prediction.
Flask: Web framework used to create API endpoints.
TensorFlow: Machine learning library used to load and execute the pre-trained model.
OpenCV: Used for video frame extraction and preprocessing.


Frontend (React)
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Axios: Used for making HTTP requests to the Flask API.
CSS: Custom styles for a modern and responsive design.
